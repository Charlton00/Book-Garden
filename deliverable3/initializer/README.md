# To Run

This was coded in Visual Studio Code in which we compiled it by running the InitializerApplication.java file found under src/main/java/com/example/initializer.
When the code is ran, the application can be started by running http://localhost:8080/homeOBS in your web browser.
Without the database, this program will not run as intended.
